// PHP is loosely typed language i.e. we do not have to declare data types while declaring variable names it automatically does that. it also have strict mode.
// in php keywords such as if, else, class, functions(includes user defined function also) are not case sensitive
echo "from echo ";
eCho "From eCho "; 

//But variables are case sensitive here $x and $X are two different variables
$x = 1;
$X =321;
echo $x. " " .$X;
